# QA Learning

This repository is a personal learning project to build a strong foundation in **Python**, **testing fundamentals**, and eventually **test automation with Playwright**.

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 1 (Foundations)
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions, classes)
- Exceptions & error handling
- Tools setup (Python, VS Code, Git/GitHub)
- Testing basics (functional, regression, exploratory)
- Writing clear bug reports
- Practice: Python script that logs in to a demo API

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 2 (Automation)
- Playwright setup with Python
- Writing first UI tests
- Running tests with pytest
- Generating reports
- Structuring a test automation project

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build solid programming & QA fundamentals
- Create a working test automation framework
- Practice professional workflows (Git, GitHub, bug reports, documentation)

â”œâ”€â”€ test_playwright.py        # First Playwright test
â”œâ”€â”€ phase1_schedule.md        # Study schedule
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                # Ignore venv, env files, IDE settings
â”œâ”€â”€ BUG_REPORT.md             # Example bug reports (to be added)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # This file
```

## ðŸ”§ Setup
Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marclfleming-me/qa-learning.git
cd qa-learning
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests
Example:

```bash
pytest -v
```
